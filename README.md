No prebuild binaries or packages are available as of yet, you'll have to build the library and link against it yourself. See [Building](#building) and [Usage](#usage) sections for more details.

Too lazy to list them off right now, check source code. Only a few filesystem facilities atm.

Feature suggestions welcome.
